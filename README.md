# Welcome!

This is my personal website, and is (very much so) a work in progress. Visit it here: 

## Bugs

1. Accessibility is very important to me, and I am currently teaching myself both React as well as accessible development as it relates to React and JSX. One of my top priorities for this website is for it to be fully accessible, but that has not yet been started.
1. The side-bar tabs belonging to the resume section are not registering when they have been activated. This is more of a UI related issue than anything else, and I have removed the resume section for the time being. 

## How did I make this?

I began with [this wonderful tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/portfolio-app-using-react-618814e35843/) from freeCodeCamp and [this free template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/ronaldo/) from colorlib. I am currently in the process of re-factoring this site to better reflect me and my interests/priorities.
